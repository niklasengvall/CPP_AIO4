# C++ All in one for dummies, 4th ed. - optimized and uppdated source code with comments

The main purpose with this project for me, is to learn more about C++ and the coding environment VS Code and it's extensions. 

The book I have used: <em>C++ All in one for dummies, 4th ed, 2021,ISBN: 978-1-119-60174-6</em>

You will find the original source code belonging to this book here:

I kept a local copy zip-formatted in this project as well: <em>CPP_AIO4.zip</em> 
Boken C++ All in one for dummies, 4th ed, 2021 

Happy coding!
